# Speed Reader

I wanted to create a simple web application to learn React.js. I decided to create a speed reading app that allows the user to copy in their desired text and read it at their choice of words per minute. Front-end really doesn't seem like my thing, but hey, you gotta start somewhere. I got to use a lot of fun Material UI components and discovered that I'm a React Hooks gal (seriously: functional components >>> class components).
