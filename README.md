# Speed Reader

I wanted to create a simple web application to learn React.js. 

I decided to create a speed reading app that allows the user to copy in their desired text and read it at their choice of words per minute. I got to use a lot of fun Material UI APIs and discovered that I'm a React Hooks gal (functional components >> class components, change my mind). I also learned how to deploy and host web apps on Firebase.
